Alt text: Once spanning more than 580 million acres, the Central Grasslands are the world’s most imperiled and least conserved ecosystem. Grasslands are being lost at a far faster pace than they are being conserved due to agricultural conversion, invasive species, and climate change.

Your key takeaways (1-2 sentences each): 

1. Once spanning more than 580 million acres, the Central Grasslands are the world’s most imperiled and least conserved ecosystem. Grasslands are being lost at a far faster pace than they are being conserved due to agricultural conversion, invasive species, and climate change.

Your data sources: 

* Comer, P.J., J.C. Hak, K. Kindscher, E. Muldavin, and J. Singhurst. 2018. Continent-Scale Landscape Conservation Design for Temperate Grasslands of the Great Plains and Chihuahuan Desert. Natural Areas Journal 38(2), 196-211. [https://doi.org/10.3375/043.038.0209](https://doi.org/10.3375/043.038.0209)

  * NatureServe data link for Comer et. al 2018 datasets: [https://transfer.natureserve.org/download/Longterm/Ecosystem_Americas/Maps/](https://transfer.natureserve.org/download/Longterm/Ecosystem_Americas/Maps/).File name: `'North American Ecosystems_IVC Distributions_2021update'`. Also check out the `'READ ME: READ ME - NatureServe Macrogroups and Terrestrial Ecological Systems of the Americas'` file.

Key programs and/or packages used:

* ArcPro (to process enormous spatial data received from study authors (NatureServe) and to create the map), R to create the stacked circular bar chart, Illustrator to bring it all together and use USFWS logo and fonts

Overall method to create this viz: 

* Predicted historic and current grassland biome spatial datasets were downloaded from NatureServe, with use approval from the authors of Comer et al. 2018. Special thanks to Emily Seddon, Vegetation Ecologist with NatureServe, for data access assistance. Grassland area loss was calculated using the con function in the raster calculator tool of ArcGIS Pro (Version 2.9.5). Grassland loss is the difference in area between predicted historic and current spatial extent for each of the 12 main grassland types identified in Comer et. al 2018. Zonal statistics were used to extract the existing and lost grassland area by state.
