Your key takeaways (1-2 sentences each):

1. The water levels at Lake Powell have fluctuated immensely in its sixty year history. However, due to consumptive water use and recent drought, the Lake's water level is currently the lowest we have seen since the Lake began filling in the mid 1960s.
2. Operations at the Glen Canyon Dam are tied to 'key functional elevations' of Lake Powell. For example, when the Lake drops below 'minimum power pool', hydroelectricity can no longer generated at the Dam. We are currently 30 feet away from minimum power pool.

Your data sources:
* Lake elevations from the Bureau of Reclamation: https://www.usbr.gov/rsvrWater/HistoricalApp.html
* Jones, D.K., and Root, J.C., 2021, Modified topobathymetric elevation data for Lake Powell: U.S. Geological Survey data release, https://doi.org/10.5066/P9H60YCF.

Key programs and/or packages used:
`R`, packages: `ggplot`

Overall method to create this viz:
Gathered information about key functional elevations from Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) documentation. Downloaded Lake Powell historic water levels from BOR historical app and recorded water levels for recent events as well as historic droughts and floods. Extracted bathymetric elevation of Lake Powell along the historic "center line" of the Colorado River from Jones & Root (2021).
