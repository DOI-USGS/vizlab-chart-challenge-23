Your key takeaways (1-2 sentences each):

1. Satellite optical and altimetry data can be combined to estimate streamflow, as shown here for the Tanana River in Fairbanks Alaska. We can use the classified water extent to estimate river width by dividing the water extent area and the length of the river, and match this data with overlapping satellite altimeters to build relationships between river width, elevation, and streamflow. 

2. Future data from the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite will provide simultaneous water extent and elevation, providing even more data!

DSWE data can be downloaded from https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/ (instructions in Rmd)

Key programs and/or packages used: `R`, packages: `dataRetrieval`, `raster`, `sf`, `cowplot`, `magick`

Overall method to create this viz: Use `raster`, `ggplot`, and `magick` to build gif of satelitte imagery of Tanana River in Alaska classified by level of confidence that water is present. Use `ggplot` to add scatterplots to show relationship between satellite river width and satellite river elevation, and satellite-derived streamflow and satellite river elevation. Use `dataRetrieval` to pull gage data and compare to satellite-derived streamflow.
