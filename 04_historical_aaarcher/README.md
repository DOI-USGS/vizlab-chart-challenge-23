Your key takeaways (1-2 sentences each):

1. Shows the minimum annual streamflow averaged by generation for 331 USGS gages that have 100 years of near complete data, by CONUS and by region 
2. Almost everywhere in the US, minimum annual streamflow levels have increased during the last few generations compared to the “Silent Generation” 
3. Minimum annual streamflow during Gen Z generation was 22% higher on average across the CONUS than it was during the Silent generation 
4. Two regions, southwest and southeast have slightly lower minimum annual streamflow levels now than they did during the silent generation 
5. Data from doi.org/10.5066/P92FAASD 
6. Uses #rstats and #OpenData
