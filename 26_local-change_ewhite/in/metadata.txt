`fish_data.csv` is the data gathered from the tables in the paper. RCP_XX column contains the change in date for that scenario and XX_SE is the standard error for that change in date. These are modeled values.  

`fish_data_from_nack.csv` is a R friendly version of `Nack_RCP_Model_Results.xlsx`, which contains the data behind the results in the final plot of the paper. The latter was obtained from personal communications with the author. I wanted to use this data to plot a probability from 0 to 1 of dates predicted for onset and cessetion of spawning, but the message wasn't coming through. I used this data to make a gif and a static plot instead. I also used this dataset to get start date and end date (1951 values), which I called origin_dates as opposed to climate changed dates. 

`fish_data_origin_dates.csv` is the 1951 values where the month and day are preserved and the year is modified to 2015 because that is the base year the Author picked for dates.
