Your key takeaways (1-2 sentences each):

1. As of 2015, thermoelectric power generation was the single largest category of water use in the United States, using 133 billion gallons per day. [Water for thermoelectric power is used in the process of generating electricity with steam-driven turbine generators](https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/thermoelectric-power-water-use?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects).

Your data sources: [National water use data](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/wu)

Key programs and/or packages used: `R`, packages: `rvest`, `ggwaffle`, `cowplot`

Overall method to create this viz: Scrape the water use data from the USGS website, generate a waffle chart for each category of water use, then arrange and annotate the charts with `cowplot`.
