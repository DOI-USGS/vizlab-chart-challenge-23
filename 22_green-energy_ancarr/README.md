Your key takeaways (1-2 sentences each):

1. Electricity generated by wind and solar energy increased in the U.S. from 2000 to 2020. Hydropower went up and down, and bioenergy and geothermal energy did not change much.
2. Hydropower was the biggest renewable source of electricity in the U.S. until 2020, when wind took the lead.
3. An extreme drought in the Pacific Northwest in 2001 caused a big drop in electricity generated by hydropower. The drought had a big effect on energy production because much of the Nation's hydropower capacity is in the Pacific Northwest.

Your data sources: [International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) renewable electricity generation data] https://pxweb.irena.org/pxweb/en/IRENASTAT/IRENASTAT__Power%20Capacity%20and%20Generation/RE-ELECGEN_2022_cycle2.px/

Key programs and/or packages used: `R`, packages: `ggplot`, `cowplot`, `magick`

Overall method to create this viz: Filter and download IRENA renewable electricity generation data using their online data query tool. Pull in data and convert it to long format. Create main plot with all renewable energy sources and small multiples highlighting each energy source on its own.
